# Iconic

Application for testing your [iconic memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconic_memory), based on [Sperling's_partial_report_procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iconic_memory#Sperling's_partial_report_procedure).

Written entirely in elm.

Still very much a WIP, will hopefully complete when I have more time.
